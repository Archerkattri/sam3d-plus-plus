# SAM 3D Objects + HiCache++

**Image-to-3D with a training-free, tree-aware *exponential* (DMD/Prony) velocity cache on the slat-stage flow matching.**

*A fork of [SAM 3D Objects](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-objects) (Meta) that skips most
network evaluations in the slat-stage flow-matching sampler by **forecasting** the cached velocity with a
**Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition exponential** basis — exact on the feature-ODE solution class where the
[HiCache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16984) polynomial drifts, so it stays lossless at a larger skip
interval. Generalised to SAM3D's **PyTree** (structured) velocities.*

## What this is

[SAM 3D Objects](https://ai.meta.com/sam3d/) reconstructs full 3D shape, texture, and layout from a
single masked image. The expensive part of inference is the **slat-stage flow-matching** sampler: an
Euler ODE solve that calls the backbone once per step over many steps.

This fork adds **HiCache++** to that sampler — *training-free, geometry-preserving* feature caching. On
most solver steps it **skips the backbone** and **forecasts** the (CFG-combined) velocity from cached
anchors, calling the network only every `interval` steps. Where [HiCache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16984)
forecasts with a scaled-Hermite **polynomial**, HiCache++ forecasts with a **DMD/Prony exponential** basis
— the exact function class a diffusion feature trajectory lives in — so quality holds at skip intervals
where the polynomial drifts. As in SAM3D the solver state and backbone velocity are
`torch.utils._pytree` **structures**, so the cache is **tree-aware**: snapshots are flattened to one
vector per step, the propagator is identified once, and the forecast is unflattened back to the tree.

> HiCache++ ships **alongside HiCache (Hermite)** here as the comparison baseline. The forecaster itself
> is packaged standalone as **[`hicache-plus-plus`](../hicache-plus-plus)**; the pure-Hermite fork is the
> sibling **`sam3d-plus`**.

## Method

A flow-matching sampler integrates `dx/dt = v_θ(x, t)`; across steps the cached velocity `F_t` evolves
under a slowly-varying, **near-linear feature-ODE** `Ḟ = M F`, whose **exact** solution class is a sum of
(damped/oscillatory) **exponentials** `Σ_j a_j e^{μ_j t}` — *not* polynomials. A polynomial basis (Taylor,
Hermite) is only a *local* truncation of that exponential and **diverges** as the skip horizon grows,
which is what caps a polynomial cache at a modest interval. **HiCache++** instead uses **Dynamic Mode
Decomposition** (Schmid 2010), the SVD-regularised generalisation of **Prony's method** (1795): identify
the linear propagator from raw velocity snapshots (`F_{t+1} ≈ A F_t`), eigendecompose it once, and predict
any (fractional) horizon `k` by eigenvalue powers `F_{t+k} ≈ Φ (λ^k ⊙ b)`. This is **exact on the
exponential class**, so it extends the lossless skip range. Because SAM3D velocities are PyTrees, snapshots
are flattened per leaf, DMD'd, and unflattened (`accel.py: dmd_*_tree`). A **≥4-snapshot floor** applies —
a real trajectory spends two real DOF per *complex* pole, so even one oscillatory mode needs rank 3 (3
pairs = 4 snapshots) — and below it (or across a non-uniform window) HiCache++ **falls back to the Hermite
forecast** for warm-up. The hook is **native**: the Euler solver calls the cache helpers directly, no
monkey-patching.

## Enable (real API)

HiCache++ lives on the Euler solver of the slat-stage `FlowMatching` module and is exposed as
`enable_dmd` (the Hermite baseline remains `enable_hicache`) — see `flow_matching/model.py`,
`flow_matching/solver.py`, `flow_matching/accel.py`:

```python
# fm is the slat-stage FlowMatching module inside the SAM 3D Objects pipeline.
# HiCache++ requires the Euler solver (one dynamics_fn eval per step).

fm.enable_dmd(
    interval=6,        # call the backbone every 6th step; forecast the other 5
    history=5,         # sliding window of raw velocity snapshots fed to DMD
    first_enhance=2,   # always run full for the first 2 (warm-up) steps
    end_enhance=None,  # always run full for the final step(s); None = last step
    max_order=2,       # Hermite order used for the <4-snapshot warm-up fallback
    sigma=0.5,         # Hermite scale for that fallback, in (0,1)
)

# baseline for comparison — the Hermite-polynomial forecaster:
# fm.enable_hicache(interval=3, max_order=1, first_enhance=2, sigma=0.5)

# optional, composable: drop the unconditional CFG pass once it aligns
fm.enable_adaptive_guidance(gamma_bar=0.94, warmup=2)

# ... run the normal SAM 3D Objects inference (generate / demo.py) ...

fm.disable_hicache()            # disable_hicache() turns off DMD too (shared slot)
fm.disable_adaptive_guidance()
```

`enable_dmd` / `enable_hicache` are also available directly on the solver
(`ODESolver.enable_dmd(...)`, which sets `backend="dmd"`); the solver resets the per-trajectory cache at
the start of every run and only activates it for `Euler`. A CPU unit test that needs no GPU or model
weights — including the DMD exact-on-exponentials and ≥4-snapshot-floor checks — ships in the accel
module:

```bash
python -m sam3d_objects.model.backbone.generator.flow_matching.accel
```

## Results

On the slat-stage `FlowMatching` (real SAM 3D Objects weights, F1 vs the uncached baseline), **HiCache++
(DMD) is geometry-lossless (F1 = 1.000) out to interval-6 at 1.56×** — where **HiCache (Hermite) is
lossless only to interval-3**. The exponential basis is what extends the lossless skip range; both methods
stay exactly on the baseline geometry up to their respective ceilings.

| config | speedup | F1 vs baseline |
|---|---:|---:|
| vanilla (uncached) | 1.00× | **1.000** |
| HiCache (Hermite) i3 | 1.44× | **1.000** |
| DMD i5 | 1.47× | **1.000** |
| **HiCache++ (DMD) i6** | **1.56×** | **1.000** |

For the controlled forecast microbenchmark (the exponential basis is ~1e-8 flat in horizon while the
polynomial diverges), the Hunyuan3D tables, and the math, see the standalone library
**[`hicache-plus-plus`](../hicache-plus-plus)**.

**SAM 3D Objects** is a foundation model that reconstructs full 3D shape geometry, texture, and layout from a single image, excelling in real-world scenarios with occlusion and clutter by using progressive training and a data engine with human feedback. It outperforms prior 3D generation models in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We released code, weights, online demo, and a new challenging benchmark.

## Installation

Follow the [setup](doc/setup.md) steps before running the following.

## Single or Multi-Object 3D Generation

SAM 3D Objects can convert masked objects in an image, into 3D models with pose, shape, texture, and layout. SAM 3D is designed to be robust in challenging natural images, handling small objects and occlusions, unusual poses, and difficult situations encountered in uncurated natural scenes like this kidsroom:

  <img src="doc/kidsroom_transparent.gif" width="40%"/>
</p>

For a quick start, run `python demo.py` or use the the following lines of code:

```python
import sys

# import inference code
sys.path.append("notebook")
from inference import Inference, load_image, load_single_mask

# load model
tag = "hf"
config_path = f"checkpoints/{tag}/pipeline.yaml"
inference = Inference(config_path, compile=False)

# load image and mask
image = load_image("notebook/images/shutterstock_stylish_kidsroom_1640806567/image.png")
mask = load_single_mask("notebook/images/shutterstock_stylish_kidsroom_1640806567", index=14)

# run model
output = inference(image, mask, seed=42)

# export gaussian splat
output["gs"].save_ply(f"splat.ply")
```

For  more details and multi-object reconstruction, please take a look at out two jupyter notebooks:
* [single object](notebook/demo_single_object.ipynb)
* [multi object](notebook/demo_multi_object.ipynb)


## SAM 3D Body

[SAM 3D Body (3DB)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-body) is a robust promptable foundation model for single-image 3D human mesh recovery (HMR).

As a way to combine the strengths of both **SAM 3D Objects** and **SAM 3D Body**, we provide an example notebook that demonstrates how to combine the results of both models such that they are aligned in the same frame of reference. Check it out [here](notebook/demo_3db_mesh_alignment.ipynb).

## Weights & data

Model weights and demo/example assets are **not** committed to this repo — only the acceleration
architecture (code + integration). Download the base-model weights from the upstream project,
[facebookresearch/sam-3d-objects](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-objects), per its instructions, and point the loader at them (see the code / upstream README). This
keeps the repository lightweight and avoids redistributing third-party weights.
